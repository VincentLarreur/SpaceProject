          I would like to thank Quaternius, Bruno Simon,
          and the Poimandres team for incredibles tools, resources that helped me thought my
          project. The <a href="https://quaternius.com/" target="_blank">Quaternius website</a> provided me with an amazing collection
          of 3D space assets that added depth and realism to my project. 
          I also
          want to express my gratitude to Bruno Simon for his incredible <a href="https://threejs-journey.com/" target="_blank">Three.js journey course</a>, which helped me develop my skills and make
          the most of this powerful tool. Finally, I would like to thank the <a href="https://pmnd.rs/" target="_blank">Poimandres</a> team for their work on the drei and R3F framework, which
          provided me with the flexibility and power I needed to create my
          project. Without the help of these talented individuals and teams, my
          project would not have been possible.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once again, thank you to Quaternius, Bruno Simon, and the Poimandres
          team for all of their hard work and dedication. I look forward to
          continuing to use their tools and resources in future projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          Also, thanks ChatGPT for writing this credits note for me, I am way too lazy for so many words.
          <br />
          <br />
          Peace !
